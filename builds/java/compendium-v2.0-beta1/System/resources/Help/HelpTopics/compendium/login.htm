<p>When you launch Compendium for the first time you will see the welcome screen.
Here you can access the Quick Start guide and help movies.</p>

<center>

<h4>Figure 1: The Compendium Welcome screen</h4>
</center>


<p>Initially Compendium will have no projects set up. So the first action you need to take after watching/reading any help
is to create a New Project. When you press the 'New Project' icon on the welcome screen you will see the New Project dialog,
as in figure 2 below, asking you to enter the details to create your
first Compendium project: </p>

<h4>Figure 2: The Compendium Application when first opened</h4>
</center>
Enter the details, as requested, in each of the fields. The compulsory fields have a '*' beside them.

<p align="left">The <b>Project Name</b> is the name as seen by you, in other words,
what do you want to call this project.</p>

<p align="left">If you want this new project to be your default project, then
check the box. This means Compendium will automatically launch this project when
you open the application. If you check the default project box, it will
automatically check the default user box below it. This is because Compendium
needs to login to the default database for you to automatically. Note that you
can check the default user box independently for any project. This will mean
that in the project login window your login details will be automatically filled
in for you. (This does not apply to remote MySQL projects for security reasons).</p>

<p align="left">The <b>User Name</b> is important to complete as it is what you wish to be known as when
you export maps and share them with other people. It is this name that is stored
against all nodes and links that you create. </p>
<p align="left">The <b>Description</b> is not a compulsory, but you might like to record a little extra detail about the user here.</p>
<p align="left">The <b>Login Name</b> and <b>Password</b> fields will be used as the login information, which
you will need to know to access this project later. This user is set as an 'Administrator'
by default.</p>
<p align="left">The <b>User Status</b> is automatically set as 'Active'. We recommend you leave it that way on this screen.</p>


<p align="left">Once you have completed all the fields, press the 'Create'
button and a new project will be created and some default data loaded in. </p>
<p align="left">Once the project has been create you will be presented with a login window, similar
to the one below, (though initially only showing your one new project):</p>

<p>If you did not check the box to make the user of your new
project the default user, you now need to enter the Login Name, and Password as
you entered them in figure 2 when you created the project. Otherwise they will
be automatically completed for you.
<br>NOTE: The login is case-sensitive.</p>
<p>Once you have pressed
the 'OK' button the project will be opened and you will see a screen similar to
the one below:</p>

There is also a 'Quick Start' movie which you can launch from the <a href="../menus.help.htm">Help Menu</a>.</p>
