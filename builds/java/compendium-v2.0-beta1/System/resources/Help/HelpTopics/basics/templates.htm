<h1>Templates</h1>

<hr width="100%" color="black"></hr>
</center>
<p>In Compendium a template is basically a Compendium xml export file, which
holds a set of maps/nodes which you wish to use over and over again. For
example, you might create a template map for a type of meeting discussion with
certain question nodes that always come up in each meeting. Then at the start of
a discussion of that type, you would create a new Map and populate it from your
meeting template.</p>
<p>What makes a Compendium xml export file a template rather than a backup or a
way or sharing data is simply the way that the file is imported. If
you import a Compendium xml file and do NOT select 'Preserve Transclusions' or
'Preserve Imported Node IDs', then Compendium creates new nodes with new node
ids rather than transclusions to existing nodes.</p>
<p>You can,&nbsp; of course do this your self through the standard <a href="../ImportExport/import_xml.htm">Import From XML</a>
option. But Compendium has some built-in support to make things easier.</p>
<p>In the Compendium application home directory, there is a subfolder called
'Templates', which initially has some suppied templates. This is suggested as the best place to
store the xml exports that you wish to use as templates. </p>
<p>There are currently two ways in which Compendium provides additional support
for using templates, and these are discussed below.</p>
<p><b>Template Menu</b></p>
<p>On the <a href="../menus/tools.htm">Tools Menu</a> there is a submenu called
'Templates'. This menu will list all files and folder found in the Templates
folder which is in your Compendium application folder. </p>
<p>It will create submenus as required by the folder structure you create in
your Templates folder. For each folder it will create a submenu and for each xml
file it will create a menu item. When you select a menu item, that xml file will
be automatically imported into the current view as a template (with new nodes
and node ids).</p>
<p>File and folder names will be turned into menu items by replacing all underscores with spaces and for files,
removing the '.xml' part of any file name. So for example the file name "Argument_from_Implication.xml" would become
a menu item "Argument from Implication".</p>
<p>If you want to provide more detail or help text about any templates you add
and you do not wish to have these as nodes within the template you can also add html files into the template folder structure.
These will also be turned into menu items in the same way as the template files except they will have this icon (<img border="0" src="../images/template-help.png">) infront of them to indicate they are help texts not templates.
When clicked they will be opened in your browser.
<br>For example the file name "Argument_from_Implication.html" would become
a menu item "<img border="0" src="../images/template-help.png"> Argument from Implication".</p>
<p>If the help file name, when cleaned, matches the current parent menu name,
then that file will be listed first in the menu as being overall help about the templates in that folder.
Otherwise the files will all be listed alphabetically.</p>

<p><b>Stencils</b></p>
<p>As part of the Stencils system, you can associate a Compendium xml file with
a Stencil item, provided it is a map or list type. When that stencil item is dragged
from the stencil palette onto a view, the map or list node is created and is populated
automatically with the contents of the associated Compendium xml file. See
<a href="stencilsets.htm">Stencils</a> section for more details.</p>
