<p>In figure 1., you can see that the Linked Files browser has three columns.
<ol>
<li><b>Location</b>: This shows you where the linked file is. It either says 'Database' if the file is held in the database, or it shows you the path to the file. If there is a reference to an image that is no loger found at the path given, it will have 'LOST:' prepended to the path.</li>
<li><b>File name</b>: This shows you the name of the linked file.</li>
<li><b>Times used</b>: This shows you how many nodes are referencing the linked file.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>If you want to see which nodes are referencing a given linked file, simply select the file row and either double-click it, or press the 'Enter' key. This will open a second window similar to figure 2 below:</p>

<h2>Deleting</h2>
To delete one or more files, select them and then press the 'Delete' key. You will be asked for confirmation.
<br>NOTE: You can only delete files that are not LOST and that have no node usage.
<h2>Extracting</h2>
To get files out of the database, or copy files to a new location, select the file(s) and then press 'Extract..'. The file browser window will open asking you for the location to extract the file(s) to. Navigate to where you want the file(s) to go and then select 'open'. A copy of the file(s) will be placed there.
