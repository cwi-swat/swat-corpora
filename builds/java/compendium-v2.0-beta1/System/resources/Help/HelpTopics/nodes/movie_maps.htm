<h1>Movie Maps</h1>

<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Movie Maps can be used to map across one or more running movies.
In a movie map each node aquires the additional dimension of time.
As will be discussed in more detail later, for each node in the map you can create one or more time spans which specify when a node is displayed during the running of the main movie, and where the nodes appears at that point.</p>

<p>For information on how to create a movie map node see <a href="../nodes/create_nodes.htm">Creating Nodes</a>).</p>

<p>When you open the movie map node, (by double-clicking it or pressing enter when the node is selected), you will initally see an empty map with a message, (see figure 1 below). In addition to this message, another difference between this and a standard map is that you will see at the bottom of the map window there is a extra bar with arrows. This is to control the split screen you will see later.</p>

<p>When you follow the instructions you will open the node contents dialog but on a new tab called Movie. This tab is where you can specify the movie(s) that you want to load into this map, (see figure 2 below).</p>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Supported movie formats are currently quite limited. Please see <a href="supported_movie_formats.htm">this page</a> for full details.

<p>To add a movie press the 'Add Movie' button. This opens a small form where you can add a movie file.<br>
It will auto-open the file chooser dialog for you to select your movie file. (See figure 3 below). </p>

<p>You can add many movies to a map, but each additional movie may have a performance hit depending on your computer, and the sizes of each of the movies.
We tested with four smallish movies and had no problems.</p>

<p>If you now add a node to the Orangutan movie map, you will see a node timeline for that node appear in the bottom half of the split screen (see figure 5 below).</p>

<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/moviemap_node.gif" alt="A Movie map with one movie and one node added">
<h4>Figure 5. A Movie map with one movie and one node added.</h4>
</center>

<p>So, for each node you will see a new node timeline appear. They will be listed in alphabetical order based on the node labels.
When you add a node, the new node timeline will initially have a 5 second timespan added.
So in figure 5, we added the node right at the start of the movie (we had not started playing the movie yet),
so we have a timespan of five seconds showing at the start of the movie.</p>

<p>This timespan represent when, during the playing of the master movie, that node will appear in the map.
So you need to add timespans for all the places you want a given node to appear when the movie is played.
If you want the node present throughout the playing of the movie  you need to increase the size of the initial timespan to be the entire length of the movie(s).

<p>You can resize a timespan by dragging on the purple squares at each end of the span.
You will see the mouse pointer change as you move over those purple squares.
whenever you move your mouse over a node timeline you will see a small hint come up telling you the time
location within the movie timeline that the mouse is currently at. This helps you size and position the spans.
In figure 6 below, you can see that the right-hand end of the timespan was dragged to 22 seconds and 80 milliseconds.
</p>

<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/moviemap_node2.gif" alt="A Movie map with one movie and one added and the being dragged out">
<h4>Figure 6. A Movie map with one movie and one added and the being dragged out.</h4>
</center>

<p>You can add a new timespan by either double-clicking on an empty section of the node timeline where you want to add the span,
or right-clicking on an empty section of the node timeline and selecting 'Add New Span' from the menu. In figure 7 below,
you can see that the right-click menu was opened when the mouse was at 27 seconds in to the movie.
</p>

<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/moviemap_menu.gif" alt="The node timeline right-click menu when on an empty section of timeline">
<h4>Figure 7. The node timeline right-click menu when on an empty section of timeline.</h4>
</center>

<p>So if you then select 'Add New Span' from the menu,that is when the 5 second new timespan will be added. (see figure 8 below)</p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/moviemap_node3.gif" alt="The node timeline right-click menu when on an empty section of timeline">
<h4>Figure 8. The node timeline with new second timspan added.</h4>
</center>


<h2><a name="times">The Node Timespan Window</a></h2>

<p>For all nodes added to a Movie Map there will be a new tab on their contents dialog called 'Times'.
This new tab will show the timespans for the node in more exact detail (see figure 9 below).</p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/timepage_1.gif" alt="The node timeline window in the contents dialog">
<h4>Figure 9. The node timeline window in the contents dialog.</h4>
</center>

<p>For each timespan on a node timeline, there will be a section in the Times window. They will be displayed in time order.
In figure 9 you will see the two timespan we added to the question node 'Orangutan - how can he whistle?'. Each entry has the start point of the timepsan (show at:) which tells the system when to display the node, and the end point of the timespan (hide at:), which tells the system when to hide the node again.
Each of these has drop-down menus for setting <b>H</b>ours, <b>M</b>inutes, <b>S</b>econds, and <b>Ms</b> Milliseconds. </p>

<p>As was mentioned above, an additional property of each timespan is the location that the node should appear at during that timespan.
So the next section in the timespan displayed in the Time window is a section on node location.
The x and y shows where the node will appear for that time span.
the initial location assign to the span is where the node is located at the time you create the new span.
If you want to relocate a node's display position for a given timepsan you can position it in the map and then press the 'Set' button.
The X button is use to delete a span.</p>

<p>For each node that you add to the map a node timeline will appear. Figure 10 shows two nodes on the map and two timelines.</p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/moviemap_node5.gif" alt="A movie map with two nodes">
<h4>Figure 10. A movie map with two nodes.</h4>
</center>

<p>You can see that the timespans have been arrange so that at first you see the question then after a few seconds the answer node appears.
<br>A little later the question disappears but the answer stays on screen. Then the question re-appears and finally neither node is visible.
This is a trivial example, but you can image how you could use this to orchestrate the nodes to appear and disappear at points through
the movie's playing to describe different ideas, point out interesting things, draw conclusions, or with multiple movies, compare and contrast and such like.</p>

<p>Figure 11, shows a more complicated movie map with four movies and many nodes, just to give you an idea of the sort of thing possible.</p>
